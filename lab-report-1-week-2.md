# Installing VScode
* [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
By clicking at the link on the top, it will guide me toward a website about downloading the VScode. I can download any versions I want from that website. Such as, macos, window, linux and so on.

Here is what the website looks like. Since each different operating system will have different versions of vscode.I can click the downward arrow near the *download for window* to select the correct version for my computer.
>
After finishing downloading the vscode file, I double clicked at it. Then it will start installing to my computer.

This is what exactly looked like after I open the VScode app.

# Remotely Connecting
Since I am a window user, I should follow the following link to download the OpenSSH using the Window Setting first.

Then I have finished setting up my course special acocunt ready from the website before class.[course-special-account](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

**After that I typed this command in the terminal of the vscode to log into the server remotely**
```
$ ssh cs15lwi22aub@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```

It asked me for my password when I typed in the log in command in the console. Once I finished typing the password, I clicked enter from the keyboard to confirm the password in order to log into the server. Furthermore, it asked me to answered the question*Are you sure you want to continue connecting(yes/no/[fingerprint])?* at the first time when I logged in. Simplely, I answered yes to continue to connecting to the server.(But this picture is not the screenshot of what I did on the first time.)
